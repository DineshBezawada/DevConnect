✅ Is t2.micro Always Free on AWS?

No, t2.micro is not always free. It is part of the 12-month AWS Free Tier, not the Always Free tier.

🕐 Free for How Long?
⏳ t2.micro is free for 12 months only — from the date you create your AWS account.

After 12 months, you will be charged standard on-demand rates for t2.micro if it's still running.

Applies to EC2 Linux, RHEL, SLES, and Windows AMIs.

📌 What's Included in Free Tier?

You get:

750 hours per month of t2.micro instance usage

That's enough to run one instance 24/7 for the month

Valid for:

t2.micro (older accounts)

t3.micro (newer accounts and newer regions)

🧠 Note: AWS is slowly phasing out t2.micro and replacing it with t3.micro in newer accounts and regions.

✅ What About Always Free?
These are part of the Always Free Tier, not tied to the 12-month limit:
Service	Always Free Limit Example
AWS Lambda	1 million requests/month
Amazon S3	5 GB of storage
DynamoDB	25 GB storage
CloudWatch	10 custom metrics
🔎 How to Check If You're Still Eligible?

Go to your AWS Console

Open Billing → Free Tier

Or check usage via Billing → Cost & Usage Reports

🧠 Summary
Question	Answer
Is t2.micro always free?	❌ No — only for 12 months
What happens after 12 months?	💸 You are billed at normal rates
What instance is now used in Free Tier?	✅ t3.micro in many new accounts
Is there an Always Free EC2 instance?	❌ No EC2 instance is always free

Let me know if you want help checking your billing or switching to t3.micro to stay within free tier (if you're eligible).

Then how can I deploy my application to always free instances 
ChatGPT said:

Great — if you're looking to deploy an application to AWS using only Always Free services, you can do it, but with some smart choices and limits. Here's a practical guide to doing this.

✅ Goal:

Deploy your application to AWS using services that are part of the Always Free Tier, so you never get charged.

💡 Key Concepts

AWS Always Free Tier includes a limited set of services — mostly serverless or micro-usage.

There is no EC2 instance (like t2.micro) that’s "always free."

But you can still deploy apps for free using other services.

✅ Best Always-Free Deployment Options
1. AWS Lambda (Serverless compute)

Run your code without provisioning servers.

✅ Always Free: 1 million requests & 400,000 GB-seconds per month

Ideal for: APIs, backend services, event-driven apps

How to deploy:

Use AWS SAM
 or Serverless Framework

Deploy REST APIs via API Gateway + Lambda

Use S3 for hosting frontend

2. Amazon S3 (Static site hosting)

Host a static website (HTML, JS, React, etc.)

✅ Always Free: 5 GB of storage, 20,000 GETs, 2,000 PUTs

Ideal for: React/Next.js SPA, landing pages

How to deploy:

Build your app (npm run build)

Upload to S3 bucket

Enable Static Website Hosting

Optional: use CloudFront (watch limits)

3. AWS Amplify Hosting

Great for frontend apps with backend integration.

Offers a limited free tier (not Always Free), but still a good option.

Easy CI/CD from GitHub

4. Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL DB)

Fully managed database — always free under certain limits.

✅ Always Free: 25 GB storage, 200 million requests/month (read)

5. Amazon API Gateway

Create RESTful or WebSocket APIs.

✅ Always Free: 1 million API calls/month

Use it with Lambda to serve your backend.

✅ Example: Free Fullstack Setup (Always Free)
Layer	AWS Service	Notes
Frontend	S3 Static Hosting	React/HTML build hosted in S3
Backend API	Lambda + API Gateway	Stateless backend functions
Database	DynamoDB	Store user data, app state
Auth (opt)	Cognito	Basic auth — has free tier
🧪 Optional: Use AWS Cloud9 or CodeCatalyst

These IDEs let you deploy and manage without needing EC2 — stick to free usage.

🚨 Important Tips to Stay Always Free

✅ Track usage in the AWS Billing Dashboard

🧾 Set up billing alerts (e.g. alert if you exceed $1)

🗑️ Delete unused resources — Lambda layers, API Gateway deployments, S3 buckets

📦 Use Lightweight frameworks (Express, Fastify, etc.)

I'm using NodeJs application for Be and react for FE micro Services 
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — you're building a microservices app using:

🖥️ Node.js for backend

🌐 React for frontend

🧩 Microservices architecture

And you want to deploy it on AWS using only Always Free Tier resources.

Let’s walk through a realistic and cost-free deployment strategy using AWS services that stay within the always-free limits.

✅ High-Level Architecture (Always Free)
Layer	Service (Always Free)	Purpose
Frontend (React)	Amazon S3 + (optional CloudFront)	Host React static files
API Gateway	Amazon API Gateway	Route requests to microservices
Backend (Node.js microservices)	AWS Lambda	Run each service as a Lambda
Database (if needed)	DynamoDB / S3 / RDS Free Tier	Store data
CI/CD (Optional)	GitHub + AWS Amplify or CodeBuild	Deploy on push
✅ Step-by-Step Deployment Plan
📦 1. Split Your Services

Each microservice should:

Be an independent Node.js app/function

Export a handler compatible with AWS Lambda (e.g., using serverless-http)

Example:

// userService.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.get('/users', (req, res) => res.json([{ name: 'Alice' }]));

const serverless = require('serverless-http');
module.exports.handler = serverless(app);

🚀 2. Deploy Node.js Microservices to AWS Lambda

You can use:

✅ Option A: Serverless Framework

Install:

npm install -g serverless


Example serverless.yml for one service:

service: user-service

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs18.x
  region: us-east-1

functions:
  getUsers:
    handler: userService.handler
    events:
      - http:
          path: users
          method: get


Deploy:

serverless deploy


Repeat this for each microservice (auth-service, product-service, etc.)

🌐 3. Set Up API Gateway

Each microservice will be exposed through API Gateway as separate paths:

/users → user Lambda

/auth → auth Lambda

/products → product Lambda

These routes can be defined in serverless.yml or configured manually in API Gateway.

🧱 4. Frontend (React) Deployment Using S3

Build your React app:

npm run build


Upload the /build folder to an S3 bucket:

aws s3 cp build/ s3://your-bucket-name/ --recursive


Enable Static Website Hosting in the bucket settings.

(Optional) Use CloudFront to serve globally with HTTPS.

🧠 5. Database Layer (Optional)
If you need a database:

Use DynamoDB (Always Free: 25 GB, 200M requests/month)

Or use Amazon RDS Free Tier (limited to 750 hours/month for 12 months)

✅ Free Tier Limits Reminder
Service	Free Tier Limit (Always)
Lambda	1M invocations/month + 400K GB-s compute
API Gateway	1M requests/month
S3	5 GB storage + 20K GET + 2K PUT
DynamoDB	25 GB storage + millions of reads/writes

Make sure your traffic + resource usage stays under these.

✅ Bonus: Monitor Billing

Go to AWS Console > Billing > Free Tier

Enable budgets and alerts for $0.01+ usage

You said:
DB is MongoDB and I'm only using URL of MongoDB to connect 
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — if you're using MongoDB as a service (like MongoDB Atlas
), and you're just connecting to it using a MongoDB URI, that's even better for staying in the AWS Always Free Tier — because:

✅ MongoDB Atlas is fully managed, separate from AWS billing, and offers its own free tier.

✅ What This Means for You

You don't need to run MongoDB inside AWS. You can:

Keep your backend (Node.js microservices) on AWS Lambda

Connect to MongoDB Atlas using your connection string (URI)

Host your frontend on S3

✅ All of this stays within free tiers, assuming reasonable usage

🔧 How to Use MongoDB Atlas with AWS Lambda
1. ✅ Get Your MongoDB Connection String

From MongoDB Atlas dashboard
:

Go to your cluster

Click Connect > Drivers > Node.js

Copy the URI:

mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/mydb?retryWrites=true&w=majority

2. 📦 Update Your Lambda Microservice Code

Example:

const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb');

let cachedDb = null;

async function connectToDatabase(uri) {
  if (cachedDb) return cachedDb;

  const client = new MongoClient(uri);
  await client.connect();
  cachedDb = client.db('mydb'); // your DB name here
  return cachedDb;
}

module.exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const db = await connectToDatabase(process.env.MONGO_URI);
  const users = await db.collection('users').find({}).toArray();

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(users),
  };
};

3. 🔐 Store Mongo URI Securely

Never hardcode the MongoDB URI.

Instead, use:

Environment variables in serverless.yml or Lambda console

Example (serverless.yml):

provider:
  environment:
    MONGO_URI: 'mongodb+srv://...'

✅ MongoDB Atlas Free Tier
Feature	Free Tier (M0)
Storage	512 MB
Shared Cluster	Yes
Max Connections	~100
Backup/Monitoring	Yes
Global deployment	Available

👉 Works great for dev / low-traffic apps.

Frontend	React on S3	✅ Always Free
Backend	Node.js on Lambda	✅ Always Free
API Gateway	REST Routing	✅ Always Free
Database	MongoDB Atlas (URI)	✅ Free Tier from MongoDB
