S02 Ep03 :-Create Our Express Server (01/08/2025)
Dev Connect:

1. Create new repo
2. Add express using npm i express
3. Add nodemon using npm i -g nodemon or sudo npm i -g nodemon (not added in package.json)
4. add mongoose using npm i mongoose
5. add SRC folder and APP.js file
6. Add server using express app.listen(3000)
7. Know about node_modules, package.json, package-lock.json
8. Difference between "^" and "~" in package.json
9. Refer the below Code

const express = require('express');

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4444;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});

app.use((req,res)=>{
res.send("Hello from DevTinder Node Server");
});
i.e:- Callback function inside app.use

                    (req,res)=>{
                    res.send("Hello from DevTinder Node Server");
                    } is called as "REQUEST HANDLER".

app.use("/user",(req,res)=>{
res.send("Hello from User Route");
});

S02 Ep04 :- Routing and Request Handlers (03/08/2025)

1. Order of the Routes matter

Examples:-
Case1:
app.use('/',()=>{})
app.use('/test',()=>{})
Only get "/" because it already included in route

Case2:
app.use('/test',()=>{})
app.use('/',()=>{})
Both routes will work

2. Install Postman
3. Login and Create Workspace and inside workspace create collection
4. Test local API
5. Play with routes and route extensions
6. Write a logic to handle GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and test in Postman
7. Explore routing and use of ?, +, (), \* in the routes
8. Use Regex /a/, /.\*abc$/
9. Reading the query params in the routes
10. Reading the Dynamic Routes

S02 Ep05 :-

1. Multiple Route handlers - Play with the code
2. next() inside route handlers
3. next function and errors along with res.send()
4. app.use('/user', rH1,[rH2,rH3],rH4,rH5);
5. What are Middlerwares ?
6. How express Js hadles requests behind the scenes. 

   What are Middlewares in Node.js?
   In Node.js (with Express.js), a middleware is a function that has access to the request (req), response (res), and next function. It can:

Modify the request or response objects.

End the request-response cycle.

Or pass control to the next middleware using next().

Simple Middleware Example
We'll create a simple Express server with:

One middleware that logs the request method and URL.

One route (/hello) that returns a message.

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// âœ… Middleware function
const loggerMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Pass control to the next handler
};

// âœ… Use the middleware
app.use(loggerMiddleware);

// âœ… Single route
app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Middleware!');
});

// âœ… Start server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});

Every request goes through loggerMiddleware.

It logs the HTTP method and URL.

Then it calls next() to pass control to the /hello route handler.

âœ… Output Example
When you visit http://localhost:3000/hello,
console logs: [2025-08-07T14:00:00.000Z] GET /hello
And in the browser, you see:
Hello, Middleware!

7. Difference between App.use and App.all in NodeJs(Express).

In Express.js, both app.use() and app.all() are used to define middleware, but they serve different purposes. Here's a clear comparison:

ðŸ”¹ app.use()
Purpose: Registers middleware functions.

Applies to: All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

Path Matching: Matches the route and all its sub-paths.

Typical Use: Logging, authentication, body parsing, etc.

Example:
js
Copy
Edit
app.use('/api', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Middleware for /api and subroutes');
  next();
});
This will run for:

/api

/api/users

/api/products/123

ðŸ”¹ app.all()
Purpose: Handles all HTTP methods for a specific route.

Applies to: Only the specified route.

Path Matching: Exact route match (can use wildcards).

Typical Use: Handling all methods on a route (e.g., custom 404, CORS preflight, etc.).

Example:
js
Copy
Edit
app.all('/test', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`Handled ${req.method} request at /test`);
});
This will run for:

GET /test

POST /test

PUT /test

etc.

ðŸ”¸ Key Differences
Feature	                       app.use()	                      app.all()
HTTP Methods	       All (but for middleware only)	     All (for routing/handling requests)
Path Matching	       Path + sub-paths	                     Exact path (unless using wildcards)
Use Case	          Middleware (auth, logging, etc.)	     Route handling for all HTTP methods
next() usage	      Typically calls next() to continue	 Often ends request with res.send()

âœ… Quick Summary:
Use app.use() for middleware that should apply broadly (e.g., across all routes).

Use app.all() when you want to handle any HTTP method for a specific path.

8. Write dummy middleware for admin
9. Write dummy middleware for all user routes except /user/login
10. Error Handling
11. Global error Handling using Middleware (app.use('/'))
12. Error Handling for each route using try catch blocks.
